Welcome to the Radical Telehealth Collective. This step-by-step guide is for new **providers and schedulers**. It will go over how to get set up in the RTC website and begin booking appointments.

We're going to first go over creating your account and logging in the first time. Then we'll enter some basic account information. Finally, for providers, we'll enter availability on the calendar so that People Requiring Care can schedule appointments with you.

All of this will only take a few minutes. Let's get started!

## Creating your account

Before creating your account, please install the [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) app, which we use for two-factor authentication.

Creating your account starts with an invite link. You should have gotten an invite link in an email from someone when you joined the RTC. Invite links expire after 72 hours, so if you need a new one or you never got one, just ask on Signal and someone will send you an invite.

Let's go to your invite URL right now.

This page has First and Last Name, Phone, Password, and Confirm Password fields, above a Register button.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadsystems/rtc-care-schedule/main/docs/img/rtc-register.png)

Here we are on the account registration page. Enter your name and phone number. The phone number needs to be the number for the phone where you have Authy installed: otherwise you will not be able to log in.

Now create a strong password and enter it (twice). Click **Register**.

You should be redirected to the login screen. Enter your email and the password you just created and click **Login**.

![An image of the Login page, with Email and Password fields, and a Login button.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadsystems/rtc-care-schedule/main/docs/img/rtc-login.png)

Now we're on the two-factor authentication, or **2FA**, page.

![An image of the Login page, with the message "Please confirm the token shown in your authenticator app." An empty field for the token appears above the Confirm and Cancel buttons.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadsystems/rtc-care-schedule/main/docs/img/rtc-verify.png)

On your phone, open the **Authy** app and tap the **Radical Telehealth Collective** logo. If you don't see it, you may just need to wait a few minutes for it to show up, but Authy should recognize your phone number and add RTC automatically. Back on the website login page, enter the token from Authy and click **Confirm**. You should now be logged in!

## Setting up your contact info

Next, let's set up your contact info.

When you first login, you'll land on the **Care Schedule**. This is a calendar with all the appointments and availabilities scheduled so far, past and future. We'll come back to this in a moment, but for now, let's finish setting up our account.

Click on **Account Settings** at the top of the page. Most of your info has been filled in already. Just enter your **Pronouns**.

![The Contact Info section contains fields for First and Last Name, Pronouns, Email, and Phone. All but the Pronouns field should be filled in for you with your Registration information.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadsystems/rtc-care-schedule/main/docs/img/rtc-contact-info.png)

If you're a provider, make sure to check  **I am a provider** and enter the two-letter abbreviation of the **State** you're licensed in. Schedulers don't need to worry about these fields.

![The Provider Fields section contains the "I am a provider checkbox" with the instructions that "All providers should check this box." Below, a State field includes the instructions to "Use the two-letter abbreviation for the state you are licensed in."](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadsystems/rtc-care-schedule/main/docs/img/rtc-provider-fields.png)

Now click **Update Contact Info**.

If you're a scheduler, good job: you're done! If you're a provider, there's one more step...

## Entering availability

Head back to the **Care Schedule**. This is where you'll enter the hours you're available to accept appointments.

![The main section of the Care Schedule is the calendar grid. This screenshot contains a view of the calendar week of September 19th through 25th, 2021. A single availability for the user "Coby Test" drawn on the grid cells for Thursday, September the 23rd, from 10 am to 2 pm.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breadsystems/rtc-care-schedule/main/docs/img/rtc-calendar-availability.png)

To create an availability, just draw straight on the calendar grid, like in Google Calendar. To move an availability, just drag it around. To lengthen or shorten it, drag the bottom edge. To delete an availability, click the little "x" in the top right corner. Your availability is now published and you're ready to start accepting appointments.

Do this as frequently or infrequently as you need to. You can schedule as far out as you like, but remember that on the intake form, appointment windows **sooner than five days from now** will not show up for people who are not logged in. That means that People Requiring Care will be able to book appointments **no sooner than five days in advance**. This is to give schedulers and providers a heads up in case you need to change anything, or take extra time to meet someone's access needs.

Schedulers and providers who are logged in don't have this restriction, so for example you could enter an availability for two days from now, and then you or a scheduler could go to the **Get Care** page to schedule on someone's behalf. We'll cover booking appointments in a different guide.

That's it for now. Thank you so much for helping us build a more caring world.
